# Machine-Learning-
This repository contains the R code we did for a final project in IE 583 Machine Learning. In this project, we 
1) Applied XGBoost and Random Forest to predict whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app ad
2) Predicted the clicks will end without download with 0.989 accuracy (sensitivity) and the clicks will end with download
with 0.84 accuracy (specificity)
